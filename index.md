I'm Makai Baker, a first-year physics PhD student at UC Berkeley and Chancellor's Fellow. I am broadly interested in theoretical cosmology and physics beyond the standard model. Before moving to the Bay, I studied physics and math at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. There, I worked with [Eric Thrane](https://ethrane.github.io/) and [Paul Lasky](https://users.monash.edu.au/~plasky/) on aspects of gravitational wave data analysis, focusing on a class of techniques known as reduced order modelling. 

I grew up in the outer east of Melbourne and wanted to make physics a career for about as long as I can remember. In my spare time I like backpacking, birdwatching, cooking (eating), and photography!
