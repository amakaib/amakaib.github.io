      Fast and accurate parameter estimation on the 17-dimensional gravitational wave signal emitted by binary neutron star mergers is presently made possible by a powerful approximation technique known as reduced order modelling. In this paper, we demonstrate that a number of new physical effects that arise in next-gen gravitational wave detectors severely limit the capabilites of reduced order modelling to make inference possible for binary neutron star systems.
