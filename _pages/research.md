    <h3>Fast Inference for Next-Gen Gravitational Wave Detectors</h3>
    <p>
      Estimating the 17 parameters of the gravitational wave signal emitted by a binary neutron star merger is made easy with current signals using a powerful approximation technique known as reduced order modelling. However, next-gen gravitational wave detectors will encounter a number of new physical effects. In this paper, we demonstrate that these effects severely limit the capabilites of reduced order modelling to make inference possible for binary neutron star systems observed with next-generation detectors.
